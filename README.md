## Introduction
The Audio Visual Center is a sub-department of the LRC to make students enjoy their learning experience by providing the necessary equipment needed for their studies.

The students of Set B from the Grade 10 level were tasked to develop an app that would help the AVC achieve their goal of enjoyment while learning.

## Problem
The AVC office has a difficulty of keeping track of equipment. They also experience having inaccurate records, lack of organization and the paper-based documentation or list costs and isn’t promoting sustainability.

## Benefits
The implementation of the AVC app provides a simple and convenient way for users to request, reserve, and manage equipment borrowing.

The AVC personnel can also save time and enjoy a clear and detailed record of all equipment borrowing activities; it makes it easy to track usage, monitor inventory levels, and identify any issues.
